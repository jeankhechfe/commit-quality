Revert "Allow compilation on platforms without USBHID support"

This reverts commit 7444cca876cf1637fd7c3d4ad1e48145b215aed8.

The commit does what it advertises - but also breaks HID support everywhere
else. Oops.

Remove the half-duplex emulation from the I/O api

Now that the half-duplex emulation code isn't used anymore, it can be
removed from the I/O stream api.
----
Handle the half-duplex emulation in the vyper2 backend

The half-duplex emulation is basically a workaround for a timing problem
in the vyper2 backend. Since no other dive computer backend uses or
needs this feature, it makes no sense to support this at the I/O layer.
It can be implemented directly in the vyper2 backend instead.
----
Use the new timer for the timestamps in the logging

Replace the platform specific code with the new timers.
----
Use the new timer for the timeout calculations

Replace the gettimeofday() based implementation with the new monotonic
timers. This makes the implementation more robust against unexpected
adjustments of the clock.
----
Add a high resolution timer module

The new timer module provides an cross-platform interface for a high
resolution monotonic clock. The timestamps are always relative to the
creation of the timer and their unit is one microseconds.

The timers can be used for logging, measuring elapsed time and
implementing timeouts.
----

----
Add support for the OSTC 2 TR

The OSTC 2 TR add supports for one or more tank pressure transmitters,
and the active transmitter is linked to the active gas mix.
----
Allow compilation on platforms without USBHID support

Revert "Shearwater: correctly handle the different models"

This reverts commit 8ea8cebb4e6c3d86b9ceb2291caa077dabd2a3f7.

Well intended, but as Jef points out it breaks download from older Shearwater
dive computers in certain situations.

Let the ringbuffer function handle a full ringbuffer

The ringbuffer_distance() function has a parameter to specify whether a
ringbuffer with identical begin/end pointers should be considered an
empty or a full ringbuffer. Hence there is no need to handle the case of
a full ringbuffer manually.
----
Suppress the warning if no O2 sensors are present

The warning about disabling the O2 sensors due to factory default
calibration values, applies only if there is at least one calibrated O2
sensor present.

This has no effect on the calibration bits, because those are already
zero if there are no calibrated O2 sensors present.
----
Integrate the connect step into the open function

There is no need to expose the two step connection setup of the
underlying socket interface in the public api. Doing so may complicate
the implementation on platforms where the native api is not based on the
socket interface (e.g. Mac OS X).

Note that the function to connect based on the IrDA service name is
removed. It's not used anywhere in libdivecomputer and since IrDA is an
outdated technology nowadays, it's unlikely we'll need it in the future.
----
Merge branch 'discovery'
----
Implement some filter functions
----
Add suport for applying a filter function

The device descriptors are extended with a filter function. During the
device discovery, this filter function is used to return only devices
that match a known dive computer.

The filtering is optional, and can be disabled by passing a NULL pointer
for the device descriptor when creating the iterator with one of the
dc_xxx_iterator_new() functions.
----
Re-write the device discovery using the iterator api

Replacing the callback based interface with an iterator based interface,
results in a more extensible abstraction with a common interface for
each of the built-in I/O implementations (serial, usbhid, irda and
bluetooth).
----

----
Cleanup the iterator internals
----
Simplify the conditional compilation

Move the global variables inside an existing conditionally compiled
block, to remove some of the #ifdef's.
----
Disable some Windows specific compiler warnings

The -Wno-pedantic-ms-format option is only needed for the MinGW target.
But for some reason, the AX_APPEND_COMPILE_FLAGS macro enables the
option for all other GCC targets too. But during compilation GCC outputs
the warning "unrecognized command line option".
----
Use SDP to auto-detect the rfcomm port number

When the port number is set to zero (which is an invalid value), detect
the port number automatically. On Windows, we can simply supply the UUID
of the serial port service, and the Windows api will take care of the
discovery. On Linux (bluez), the SDP discovery needs to be performed
manually to retrieve the port number.

Fix #524 and #526: Broken in non-English Thunderbird

A string added in the Firefox 60 fix wasn't copied to the non-English `messages.json` files, which meant that it wasn't in the non-English `strings.properties` and `string.dtd` files. This caused Thunderbird to not load the overlay in Thunderbird, which prevented it from being present in the message window.

To help mitigate this in the future, to some degree, the `i18n.js` script makes sure that all English strings are present in the other languages when creating the the .properties and .dtd files. But I still have to remember to run that script.
