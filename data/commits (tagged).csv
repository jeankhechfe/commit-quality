The suunto xml is just completely crazy.  What's the helium percentage
companion to ""o2pct""? Would it be ""hepct""? No. It's ""hepct_0"".

Ok, so they didn't number the first o2pct, which could be seen as sane:
that's the only mix value that should always exist.  And they clearly
started their indexing with 0.  So with multiple mixes, you'd then
expect ""o2pct_1"" and ""hepct_1"", right?

Wrong! Because XML people are crazy, the second O2 mix percentage is
obviously ""o2pct_2"".  So the O2 percentages are one-based, with an
implicit one.  But the He percentages are zero-based with an explicit
zero.  So the second mix is ""o2pct_2"" and ""hepct_1"".

I'd like to ask what drugs Suunto people are on, but hey, it's a Finnish
company.  No need to ask.  Vodka explains everything.  LOTS AND LOTS OF
VODKA.

'gasmix' node.  Of course, now we have so many different XML nesting
nodes to check that I just made it an array of different noces.  That

It turns out that libdivecomputer has been doing some drugs too when it

percentages as -155.0%.

Clearly libdivecomputer uses a 'unsigned char' for oxygen percentage,

out, and in the process does MATH on the damn thing (""100-O2"") to

That means that we don't have random names, we don't have crazy random

It was a mistake to save it - and I did it just because other dive
managers did.  It's a totally nonsensical measure, and nobody cares.
The only thing that matters is the size of the cylinder, and the
*actual* pressures.  Those give actual air consumption numbers, and are
meaningful and unambiguous.

So the ""working pressure"" for a cylinder is pointless except for two
things:

 - if you don't know the actual physical size, you need the ""working
   pressure"" along with the air size (eg ""85 cuft"") in order to compute
   the physical size.  So we do use the working pressure on *input* from
   systems that report cylinder sizes that way.

 - People may well want to know what kind of cylinder they were diving,
   and again, you can make a good guess about this from the working
   pressure.  So saving information like ""HP100+"" for the cylinder would
   be a good thing.

But notice how in neither case do we actually want to save the working
pressure itself.  And in fact saving it actually makes the output format
ambiguous: if we give both size and working pressure, what does 'size'
mean? Is it physical size in liters, or air size in cu ft?

So saving working pressure is just wrong. Get rid of it.

I'm going to add some kind of ""cylinder description"" thing, which we can
save instead (and perhaps guess standard cylinders from input like the
working pressure from dive logs that don't do this sanely - which is all
of them, as far as I can tell).

This allows us to use a more compact date format that doesn't need to
sort alphabetically, because sorting by date is always based on the date
value.  So we can use just a two-digit year, and skip the seconds, to
keep the column narrow, while still sorting correctly.

Also, ""Depth"" is a nice header string, but it is wider than the column
itself, which makes the whole column wider than necessary.  So put the
units in the header instead of in the string, keeping things narrow.

I'll want to also add a way to override/set the cylinder type: both
manually by just setting a size in liters, and by picking from some list
of standard cylinder sizes.

For example, it looks like most of my dives are marked as having
12-liter cylinders.  That is probably some default from Suunto Dive
Manager, or from whatever Dirk did.  It's almost certainly not right for
any of them: as far as I know, the standard cylinders for Lahaina Divers
(which is likely most of the warm water dives) are AL72's for air, and
AL80's for Nitrox.

That would be a 10L and a 11.1L tank respectively, afaik.  I don't know
what a 12-liter tank would be or where that size comes from.

Anyway, the LP85+ tank designation for some of the dives looks more
likely: that's one of the common sizes I've used for local dives.  So
the size of that thing is much more probably correct.

NOTE! MicroEmacs is very much a byte-based editor, and the new utf-8
support is purely an issue of terminal input and output.  The file
contents themselves are in the 8-bit space.  In that space, Unicode is
the same as Latin1.

The new mode is called ""utf-8"", and is enabled automatically by the
new emacs.rc when $LANG contains the substring ""UTF-8"".

I'm sure people would like to some day also edit real UTF-8 contents,
rather than just edit old 8-bit Latin1 contents in a UTF-8 terminal.

Commit 8fc7449 (""uemacs: fix sparse warnings, making file-local symbols
static."") made some functions that are not used anywhere static. This patch
removes them to kill the following compilation warnings:

  vmsvt.c:521: warning: �hellovms� defined but not used

The 'tcapkopen()' function re-initializes the terminal with the 'ti'
sequence, which for most sane termcap entries is just empty.  But for
'xterm', that seems to actually be a real control sequence (clear and
reset?), and we'd better tell display.c that the screen is now garbage
and needs to be re-drawn.

Also, make tcapkclose() match the 'ti' (terminal init) with a 'te'
(terminal exit).

Maybe we should just stop playing games with ti/te, but this at least
improves the situation a bit.
