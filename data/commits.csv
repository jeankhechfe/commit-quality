The suunto xml is just completely crazy.  What's the helium percentage
companion to ""o2pct""? Would it be ""hepct""? No. It's ""hepct_0"".

Ok, so they didn't number the first o2pct, which could be seen as sane:
that's the only mix value that should always exist.  And they clearly
started their indexing with 0.  So with multiple mixes, you'd then
expect ""o2pct_1"" and ""hepct_1"", right?

Wrong! Because XML people are crazy, the second O2 mix percentage is
obviously ""o2pct_2"".  So the O2 percentages are one-based, with an
implicit one.  But the He percentages are zero-based with an explicit
zero.  So the second mix is ""o2pct_2"" and ""hepct_1"".

It turns out that libdivecomputer has been doing some drugs too when it

percentages as -155.0%.

Clearly libdivecomputer uses a 'unsigned char' for oxygen percentage,

It was a mistake to save it - and I did it just because other dive
managers did.  It's a totally nonsensical measure, and nobody cares.
The only thing that matters is the size of the cylinder, and the
*actual* pressures.  Those give actual air consumption numbers, and are
meaningful and unambiguous.

So the ""working pressure"" for a cylinder is pointless except for two
things:

 - if you don't know the actual physical size, you need the ""working
   pressure"" along with the air size (eg ""85 cuft"") in order to compute
   the physical size.  So we do use the working pressure on *input* from
   systems that report cylinder sizes that way.

 - People may well want to know what kind of cylinder they were diving,
   and again, you can make a good guess about this from the working
   pressure.  So saving information like ""HP100+"" for the cylinder would
   be a good thing.

But notice how in neither case do we actually want to save the working
pressure itself.  And in fact saving it actually makes the output format
ambiguous: if we give both size and working pressure, what does 'size'
mean? Is it physical size in liters, or air size in cu ft?

So saving working pressure is just wrong. Get rid of it.

I'm going to add some kind of ""cylinder description"" thing, which we can
save instead (and perhaps guess standard cylinders from input like the
working pressure from dive logs that don't do this sanely - which is all
of them, as far as I can tell).

This allows us to use a more compact date format that doesn't need to
sort alphabetically, because sorting by date is always based on the date

keep the column narrow, while still sorting correctly.

Also, ""Depth"" is a nice header string, but it is wider than the column
itself, which makes the whole column wider than necessary.  So put the

I'll want to also add a way to override/set the cylinder type: both
manually by just setting a size in liters, and by picking from some list
of standard cylinder sizes.

For example, it looks like most of my dives are marked as having
12-liter cylinders.  That is probably some default from Suunto Dive
Manager, or from whatever Dirk did.  It's almost certainly not right for
any of them: as far as I know, the standard cylinders for Lahaina Divers
(which is likely most of the warm water dives) are AL72's for air, and
AL80's for Nitrox.

That would be a 10L and a 11.1L tank respectively, afaik.  I don't know
what a 12-liter tank would be or where that size comes from.

Anyway, the LP85+ tank designation for some of the dives looks more
likely: that's one of the common sizes I've used for local dives.  So
the size of that thing is much more probably correct.
